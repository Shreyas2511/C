Aim- To write a C program for finding the
greatest of three numbers using logical
operators.
Pseudo code:
BEGIN
DEFINEa,b,c
READ a,b,c
IF ((a>b) && (a>b)) then
DISPLAY “ a is greatest:%d, ‘a’”
ELSE IF ((b>a) && (b>c)) then
DISPLAY “ b is greatest:%d, ‘b’”
ELSE DISPLAY “ c is the greatest:%d, ‘c’ “
END
