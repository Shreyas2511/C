AIM : To find the Area and Perimeter of Rectangle, Square and Triangle
PSUEDO CODE:
BEGIN
DEFINE L, B, Side, Base, Height, TriSide, RectAr, RectP, SqAr, SqP, TriAr, TriP
READ L, B, Side, Base, Height, TriSide
CALCULATE RectAr = L*B
CALCULATE RectP = 2*(L+B)
CALCULATE SqAr = Side*Side
CALCULATE SqP = 4*Side
CALCULATE TriAr = 0.5*Base*Height
CALCULATE TriP = 3*TriSide
DISPLAY RectAr, RectP, SqAr, SqP, TriAr, TriP
END
